I can always find it in my purse & I have gotten a few compliments regarding it.  Case is very durable, be careful when wearing w/jeans.  I sort of messed mine up, the color faded onto the case but it's still cute.  Delivery was very quick.  I also like the fact that they sent me a screen protector too!"}

Get this if you like the style and if you are one of the types that go through all extremes to keep something nice and protected. I love it personally because I have a newer Camaro and this matches my car and color. I also have not seen anyone else with this cover and many people ask me about it. Beware though, kids might try to play with it like a car, and as stated, this provides pretty much no protection so be wary.I also got the case in great shape and had no problems with the shipping."}

I've had it for almost two weeks and I bought it more for fashion than function, but it's actually pretty great. It's made of a flexible plastic that is easy to put on and take off, but sturdy enough that I'm not afraid of damage occurring to my phone or to the case itself while it's in my purse. The paint is part of the plastic, not painted on the surface so the face and body should last for a while. Overall, I would recommend this case to another Rilakkuma fan."}
